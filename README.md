Important Note on Routing:
Instead of using the default localhost:3000, which involves setting up nested routes, you can directly access the project by navigating to the specific endpoint:
localhost:3000/users: The primary entry point for the project.
This approach was chosen to streamline testing within the limited submission time frame.

Project Submission: 
Admin Dashboard with RBAC UI
I initially created the Admin Dashboard project as a comprehensive platform for managing users, roles, and permissions. For this assignment, I have further enhanced and adapted it specifically to demonstrate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionality.

Project Description and Role in Implementation:
This project features a fully functional Admin Dashboard UI built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI. The primary focus is on implementing an RBAC system where users can be assigned specific roles and permissions.

Key Features:
User Management: Add, edit, and delete users.
Role Management: Define and assign roles with granular permissions (Read, Write, Delete).
Permissions Management: Customize user access based on their role.

My Role:
I designed and developed the UI, ensuring seamless navigation between modules. I implemented the RBAC system, managing roles and permissions through dynamic components and state management. This involved creating reusable components for listing users, roles, and permissions, and ensuring a smooth UX.
